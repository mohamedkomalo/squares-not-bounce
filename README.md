Once upon a time, Far away, above in the air, there was a magical world where Dayra ("circle" in Arabic) lived bouncing on her air trampolines. But that is about to change, as the squares have decided to invade this magical world and bounce on Dayra's trampolines too. Dayra asked herself "My trampoliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiines, what I will do now ?". Dayra decided that squares shall not bounce here.

Help Dayra throw the squares out of the trampolines.

Note:
- the game is far early from being finished, I might continue developing it after the jam
